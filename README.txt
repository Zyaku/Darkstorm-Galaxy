Attack On The Darkstorm Galaxy Game.

Rules:
Find the spaceships before you run out of steps.
Numbers indicate how many spaceships can be seen from that point.
Line of sight is similar to the Queen in Chess/ 45 degree increment.
One ship can block the line of sight of another ship if they are aligned.
Finding one spaceship will reward one bonus turn.

Incoming improvements:

Much better Line of Sight Algorithm

Have fun :)
